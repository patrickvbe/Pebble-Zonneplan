# Pebble Energy Tarifs

Displays dynamic energy tariffs on the Pebble watch. Currently, only Dutch tariffs are supported (like Zonneplan and Tibber) and only in hourly rates (I think the quarterly rates are only useful for usage in automations).
The tariffs are obtained from the website www.stroomperuur.nl (anybody know if they can be obtained immediately from the apex spot market?). You can configure the "inkoopvergoeding", BTW and energy taxes, if you want to include any of them is the displayed tariffs.
